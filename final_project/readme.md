Project Title:
Bean Boozled Assistant.
Get a chance to combine Bean Boozled Jelly Beans & Claw machine. Enjoy the game with a little bit of robotics.


Getting Started:
Hardware:
1 - Arduino Uno Board;
3 - Servo motors;
 1 - Joystick;
 1 - Button;
 1 - Claw;
 Wires;
 Rails for the arm;
 Platform to secure your arm.
 
 Software:
Install Arduino from arduino.cc and include Servo library. The code that was used is attached to the folder.

Installation:

1. Connect servo motors to ground, 5V, and digital pins, i.e. 3, 4, 5.
2. Connect joystick: VCC to 5V, GRND to ground, HORIZ to analog pin A0, VERT to analog pin A1
3. Connect button: connect one lead to ground, another lead to digital pin 8 and 1kÎ© resistor. Resistor connects to 3.3V.

Software:
1. Create Servo objects.
2. Read the values from potentiometers and assign them to variables.
