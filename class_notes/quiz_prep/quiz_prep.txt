random select LED
 - you would need an array of LEDs
 - then in setup(), there would be a loop 
   that would create an OUTPUT for an array of lights
 - in loop() turn all of them off by using a loop
 - for randomize random use randomSeed(analogRead(0));
 - LEDs 
	- pinMode, digitalWrite
 - delay, microSeconds(for sounds)
 - arrays
 - for loops & void loop()
 - Serial monitor/ begin(9600) / println && print
 - map value from to values
 - speakers/ potentiometers
 - breadboard
 - wires
 - resistors
