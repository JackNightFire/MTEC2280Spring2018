II. Arduino Projects:

1. Arduino Dice.
http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Dice-1/
This is a reall easy but really cool idea in my opinion. I play board games with my friends and dice is very important piece of a lot of them.
For this project, I should brush up on random functions again, but overall I think the knowledge that I got in class would be enough to build a dice.

2. Panner with Arduino
http://www.instructables.com/id/Panner-With-Arduino/
I like photography, especially timelapses. Panner created really cool effects of motion, but they are really expensive to have.
For this project, I need to learn about Servo, millis, attachInterrupt. 

3. Knife Sharpening Angle Coach with Arduino and Bluetooth
http://www.instructables.com/id/Bluetooth-Arduino-BNO055-Knife-Sharpening-Angle-Co/
I have sharpening stones and it's hard to align a knife to sharpen it properly. This is the hardest projects so far.
I would need to learn how to import, read, and control Bluetooth, sensor manipulation, and soldetring. But everything is available on
Internet which is a huge helper.
