Idea #1: 
                  Tea Filler.
  It would be nice to have a robot arm that would take hot tea and fill a thermos in the morning. That way I would have more time for morning routine without a hassle to boil water and fill the thermos. I don't have an electrical tea kettle and every morning I have to boil water and pour it in a thermos. Robot hand could help me. 
  I would need to learn robot arm mechanics, figure out how to precisely control the arm and measure where to start and sop and not spill hot water.

Idea #2:
               Knife sharpener.
  I have about 6-7 knives and it would be aewsome to have an arm that would sharpen them. There is a project that can tell a person the angle of a knife when it is getting sharpen on a wet stone.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Bluetooth-Arduino-BNO055-Knife-Sharpening-Angle-Co/ . so it would be awesome if that could serve as an indicator to get the right angle and keep it through the sharpening process. Also, I would need to measure the range of motion for the arm so it would not slide from the stone.

Idea #3:
